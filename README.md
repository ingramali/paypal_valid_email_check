# paypal_valid_email_check

THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY !!

This is to show how easy it can be to make an automatic robot to get data from sites, if they don't hide the csrf token properly, just with PHP and the powerful Curl.

I used paypal because have a good ip and robot detection system, that's because is good for an example.

** The script don't work well unless you use clean proxies **

In this case as it is payal they have a good ip score detection system, so you must use clean proxies otherwise you will not be able to get results because high rate recaptchas.
